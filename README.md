# oledbrooch
A fork of Becky Stern's WiFi OLED Display Badge code for tinkering, originally available at https://learn.adafruit.com/digital-display-badge/code. This project is designed to run on an Adafruit Feather HUZZAH ESP8266 (or compatible board).

"Create an internet connected display brooch and wear your data on your sleeve (or jacket, or backpack...)! This simple Adafruit IO project pulls forecast data from IFTTT and displays it on a FeatherWing OLED display, made wearable with a magnetic pin back. It also toggles to display a favorite quote, or serve as a nametag!"
